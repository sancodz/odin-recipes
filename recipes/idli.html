    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Idli is a type of savoury rice cake, originating from South India, popular as a breakfast food in Southern India and in Sri Lanka. The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolised by the body.</p>

        <li>2 cups rice</li>
        <li>1 cup black gram(de-husked)</li>
