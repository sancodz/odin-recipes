    <p>Fish curry, also known as Meen kulambu(Tamil), is an Indian and Goan dish. It consists of sardines semi-stewed in a Kerala-style curry with assorted vegetables, such as okra or onions. It is usually served with rice or tapioca. The dish is most popular in Kerala, Goa, and Sri Lanka, where rice and fish are staple foods. Other variations may include adding tamarind juice or coconut milk.</p>
