    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Payasam, also known as kheer or payesh, is a pudding/porridge popular in the Indian subcontinent, usually made by boiling milk, sugar or jaggery, and rice. It can be additionally flavored with dried fruits, nuts, cardamom and saffron. Instead of rice, it may contain cracked wheat, vermicelli or tapioca.[1]</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup javvarisi (sago)</li>
        <li>3 tsp ghee</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cashews</li>
        <li>1 tbsp dry grapes</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup jaggery</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cardamom powder</li>
        <li>2 cups thick boiled milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean and soak the javvarisi with adequate water for 2 hours. It enlarges in size hence choose the vessel accordingly.</li>
        <li>Boil milk and let it come to room temperature. I used thick full fat milk hence used as it is. If your milk is thin, you can reduce it by keeping in low flame and occasional stirring to thicken the consistency. This is an optional step. For vegan choice use soya milk or coconut milk.</li>
        <li>Powder jaggery and keep aside.</li>
        <li>Heat some ghee in a pan, fry cashews and dry grapes to golden brown color and keep aside.</li>
        <li>In another pan, boil two cups of water.</li>
        <li>Add salt when water comes to a boil, add soaked drained javvarisi.</li>
        <li>Cook the javvarisi for up to 20 minutes until it becomes transparent and soft. Cooking time varies depending upon the size of the javvarisi. Check by pressing one with your fingers.</li>
        <li>Only after when the javvarisi is cooked completely, add the powdered jaggery and mix well. 3/4 cup of jaggery is good for one cup of javvarisi.</li>
        <li>Just let the javvarisi to absorb the sweetness for five minutes.</li>
        <li>Now add cardamom powder, reduce the heat and finally add boiled room temperature milk.</li>
        <li>Mix well and add the fried cashews along with the ghee.</li>
        <li>Do not cook after adding milk otherwise, the jaggery may curdle the milk.</li>
        <li>Switch off immediately and serve warm or chilled.</li>
    </ol>
